# excel-challenge
Organization and analysis of a database of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects for useful trends. 

Using excel, my goal is to attempt to identify trends in kickstarter data which would better inform an individual on what type of campaigns tend to be successful (reaching their monetary goal within a set timeframe).
